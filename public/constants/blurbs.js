    `"Beautiful and brave and brilliant, shot through with mystery and love, Two-Step Devil is a novel that only Jamie Quatro could have written -- and only, I suspect, with an angel peering over her shoulder."`,
    `“Jamie Quatro is a writer of sinuous, muscular power and grace. Two-Step Devil is a starkly gorgeous story of God and loss and art and love, and her best book yet.”`,
    `“Reading this novel is like holding on to a live wire. Jamie Quatro is the real thing. The music of these sentences lights my hair on fire.”`,
    `"Bold, ingenious, impassioned . . .  a wild and rich entertainment, a profound interrogation of God’s ways to Man, and–perhaps most daring of all—a story of simple human compassion.”`,
    `“Two-Step Devil compelled me with almost supernatural force. I could not turn away...unequivocally human, tender and alive—formally daring and utterly riveting."`,
    `"Glorious, rich, mad, wonderful, daring and epic in its scope, Two-Step Devil is simply thrilling to read."`,
    `"The characters in Jamie Quatro's Two-Step Devil will surely join the pantheon of Hazel Motes, Temple Drake, and Howard Finster."`,
